# Addon Installer|Script Runner  (BlenderAddon)
# to install/reload addons (even several at once) | run scripts from any blender area or from an external IDE and install/reload addons paste in the blender Text Editor 



## Install/reload addon *.py or *.zip | Run script from File (using a browser) 
so you can edit an addon or a script with an external text editor, save it, and run the function

## New feature: Now multi file selection supported and so multi Install/reload 
ideal to install/reinstall a list of addon and updated one... (*.py or *.zip)

## Install/reload addon from Text editor (you can just drag the file)
this is usefull to modify an addon directly in the text editor
you can create an addon from scratch too in the text editor too it will use the name there

N.B: this addon comes from my work and the use of the browser was inspired by Amaral Krichman's addon: addon-reloader
