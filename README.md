# Addon Installer|Script Runner  (BlenderAddon)
# to install/modify addons (even several at once) | run scripts from any blender area or external IDE

## New feature: Now multi file selection supported
So you can install several selected addons at once (*.py or *.zip)

## Install/reload addon *.py or *.zip | Run script from File (using a browser) 
so you can edit an addon or a script with an external text editor, save it, and run the function

## Install/reload addon from Text editor (you can just drag the file)
this is usefull to modify an addon directly in the text editor, like cutting some parts and and the effect
you can create an addon from scratch in the text editor too and use it to install and then reload

N.B: this addon comes from my work and the idea around the browser from an addon of Amaral Krichman that you can find on github.
